# Employee Management System (EMS) - Production Ready

A full-stack MERN application for managing employees, attendance, leaves, and payroll with secure RBAC.

## Features

- **Authentication**: JWT based Login/Logout with automated token persistence.
- **RBAC**: Separate dashboards and permissions for ADMIN and EMPLOYEE roles.
- **Attendance**: Daily check-in/out logic with "late" detection.
- **Leaves**: Application process with Admin approval/rejection and email notifications.
- **Payroll**: Automated salary record generation and PDF salary slip downloads.
- **Analytics**: Admin dashboard with Recharts visualization of payroll and attendance.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- MongoDB (Running locally or MongoDB Atlas)
- Mailtrap account (optional, for testing leave notifications)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

    cd server
    npm install

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory using the provided `.env.example`. Make sure to add your MongoDB URI and JWT Secret.

### 2. Frontend Setup

    cd client
    npm install

### 3. Running the Application

Open two terminals:

Terminal 1 (Backend):
cd server
npm start

Terminal 2 (Frontend):
cd client
npm start

## Initial Admin Creation

The first user must be registered via the API or directly in MongoDB. You can use Postman to register an admin:
POST `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register`
Body:
{
"name": "Admin User",
"email": "admin@ems.com",
"password": "admin@123456",
"role": "ADMIN",
"baseSalary": 5000
}

## Default Ports

- Backend: 5000
- Frontend: 3000

## Troubleshooting

- **CORS Errors**: Ensure the `cors` middleware is properly configured in `server.js` matching your client URL.
- **DB Connection**: Ensure MongoDB is running before starting the server.
- **Emails**: If using Mailtrap, verify your SMTP credentials in the `.env` file.
  Create a complete production-ready Employee Management System using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
